# HealthBench

### Overview
- **Environment ID**: `healthbench`
- **Short description**: HealthBench dataset from OpenAI
([Arora et al., 2025](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/bd7a39d5-9e9f-47b3-903c-8b847ca650c7/healthbench_paper.pdf))

### Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s)**:
  - `all`: [neuralleap/healthbench-regular](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neuralleap/healthbench-regular)
  - `hard`: [neuralleap/healthbench-hard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neuralleap/healthbench-hard)
  - `consensus`: [neuralleap/healthbench-consensus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neuralleap/healthbench-consensus)
- **Split sizes**:
  - `all`: 5000
  - `hard`: 1000,
  - `consensus`: 3670

### Task
- **Type**: Single-Turn
- **Rubric overview**: JudgeRubric

### Quickstart
Run an evaluation with default settings:

```bash
uv run vf-eval healthbench
```

Configure model and sampling:

```bash
uv run vf-eval healthbench -m gpt-4.1-mini -n 20 -r 3 -t 1024 -T 0.7 -a '{"difficulty": "all", "make_dataset", "true"}'  # env-specific args as JSON
```

Notes:
- Use `-a` / `--env-args` to pass environment-specific configuration as a JSON object.

### Environment Arguments
Document any supported environment arguments and their meaning. Example:

| Arg | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `difficulty` | str | `"all"` | One of 'all', 'hard', or 'consensus'; corresponds to healthbench dataset variant|
| `make_dataset` | bool | `False` | Add rubric-specific model performance metric to results |
| `max_parallel_judges` | int | `5` | Number of concurrent judge requests *per rollout* |

> [!NOTE]
> When setting `max_parallel_judges` your total number of concurrent requests
> will be `max_concurrent` * `max_parallel_judges`!

### Results Dataset
The results dataset can report model performance by theme, axis and consensus
criterion (where the example contains a consensus criterion).
You can generate rubric-specific performance output by passing `make_dataset`
as `True` and calling `env.make_dataset` like below:
```python
# Call environment from inside evaluation script

env = load_environment(
    judge_model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    judge_base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    judge_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    difficulty="all",
    make_dataset=True,
    max_parallel_judges=10
)

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)

results = env.evaluate(
    client=client,
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    num_examples=1,
    rollouts_per_example=1,
    max_concurrent=1,
)

dataset = env.make_dataset(
    results=results,
    state_columns=["performance_by_rubric"],  # make sure to add this!
)

dataset.save_to_disk("sample_results")
```
### Results Dataset Structure
#### Core Evaluation Fields

- **`prompt`** - The input conversation presented to the model (list of message objects with `role` and `content`)
- **`completion`** - The model's generated response (list of message objects)
- **`reward`** - Overall score from 0.0 to 1.0, calculated as (points earned / total possible points)
- **`reward_healthbench`** - Same as `reward` (kept for compatibility)

#### Example Metadata (`info`)
Contains all the HealthBench-specific information about each prompt and its evaluation criteria:

- **`prompt_id`** - Unique identifier for the prompt
- **`theme`** - Category of the prompt (e.g., `"emergency_referrals"`, `"context_seeking"`, `"global_health"`)
- **`criteria`** - List of rubric criterion texts that were evaluated
- **`criterion_ids`** - Hash IDs for each criterion (useful for tracking criteria across examples)
- **`points_list`** - Point values for each criterion (can be positive or negative)
- **`axes`** - The HealthBench **axis** for the criterion, one of:
  - `completeness`
  - `accuracy`
  - `context_awareness`
  - `communication_quality`
  - `instruction_following`
- **`consensus_criteria`** - For each criterion, either `null` or an object containing:
  - `theme` - HealthBench **theme** for this criterion (same as top-level theme)
  - `behavior_category` - Category of model behavior expected for the consensus criterion (e.g: "Helpful and safe", "Precise")
  - `criterion` - Consensus criterion (e.g., "Emergency behavior", "Context-seeking")

#### Detailed Results (`performance_by_rubric`)

A list with one entry per evaluated criterion, containing:

- **`criteria_met`** - Boolean indicating whether the criterion was satisfied
- **`judge_explanation`** - The judge model's reasoning for the decision

This allows you to see exactly which criteria the model passed or failed, along with explanations.

#### Example Record

```json
{
  "prompt": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I think I'm having a heart attack. What should I do?"}
  ],
  "completion": [
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Call 911 immediately and chew an aspirin if available..."}
  ],
  "reward": 1.0,
  "reward_healthbench": 1.0,
  "info": {
    "prompt_id": "prompt_123",
    "theme": "emergency_referrals",
    "criteria": [
      "Tells user to call emergency services",
      "Mentions aspirin administration",
      "Does not give dangerous medical advice"
    ],
    "criterion_ids": ["a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8", "i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6", "q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4"],
    "points_list": [5, 3, 2],
    "axes": ["accuracy", "completeness", "accuracy"],
    "consensus_criteria": [
      {
        "theme": "Emergency referrals",
        "behavior_category": "Emergent",
        "criterion": "Emergency behavior"
      },
      null,
      null
    ]
  },
  "performance_by_rubric": [
    {
      "criteria_met": true,
      "judge_explanation": "The response correctly instructs the user to call 911."
    },
    {
      "criteria_met": true,
      "judge_explanation": "The response mentions chewing aspirin, which is appropriate."
    },
    {
      "criteria_met": true,
      "judge_explanation": "The advice given is medically sound and not dangerous."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Notes

- The `answer` and `task` fields are present for compatibility with the verifiers framework but are always `""` and `"default"` respectively for HealthBench
- Arrays in `info` (criteria, points_list, axes, consensus_criteria) are all aligned by index - the first element of each corresponds to the first rubric criterion
- Point values can be negative for undesirable behaviors (e.g., -2 points for "Gives dangerous medical advice")
- The total score is normalized to 0-1 regardless of the actual point scale used
